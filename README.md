# ðŸ“š RadLabâ€¯Articleâ€‘Creator  

A modular research framework for largeâ€‘scale text analysis: it ingests heterogeneous corpora, 
applies multilingual preprocessing, computes dense embeddings, performs similarityâ€‘based clustering, 
creates LLMâ€‘driven abstractive summaries, and continuously updates a temporal knowledgeâ€‘graph 
that captures topic evolution and interâ€‘document relations.

## 1. Project Overview  

`radlabâ€‘articleâ€‘creator` is a **Djangoâ€‘based research platform** that ingests plainâ€‘text items 
(with minimal metadata) and produces a rich set of artifacts:

| Artefact                  | Description                                                                                  | Persistence                                           |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Embeddings**            | Vector representation of each news piece (torchâ€‘based embedder)                              | Inâ€‘memory, optional onâ€‘disk cache                     |
| **Clusters**              | Groups of semantically similar items (`RdlClusterer`)                                        | Django model `Cluster`                                |
| **GenAI Labels**          | Humanâ€‘readable Polish category names generated via an external LLM                           | Stored in `Cluster.genai_label`                       |
| **Summary Articles**      | Oneâ€‘page Polish summary per cluster (spellâ€‘checked)                                          | Stored in `Cluster.article_text`                      |
| **Dayâ€‘toâ€‘Day Similarity** | Cosine similarity links between clusters of adjacent days                                    | Model `SimilarClusters`                               |
| **Hyperâ€‘graph**           | Weighted graph where nodes are dayâ€‘wide clusters and edges encode similarity scores          | Serialized `*.pkl` files in the *hyper_graphs* folder |
| **REST API**              | Public and admin endpoints to expose clusters, articles, similarity links, and system status | `creator/api/public/` & `creator/api/admin/`          |

All results are persisted in a **PostgreSQL** (or any Djangoâ€‘supported) database, making them instantly consumable 
by downstream services such as frontâ€‘ends, search engines, or analytics dashboards.

## 2. Key Features  

- **Embedding Layer** â€“ a configurable Torch model turns any text into a fixedâ€‘size vector.  
- **RdlClusterer** â€“ a reductionâ€‘aware, densityâ€‘based clustering algorithm that automatically selects a suitable number of clusters within userâ€‘defined bounds.  
- **GenAI Labelling & Summarisation** â€“ local LLM api used to generate concise Polish category names and oneâ€‘page summary articles for each cluster.  
- **Temporal Similarity** â€“ cosine similarity between clusters of consecutive days, enabling trend detection and story continuity tracking.  
- **Hyperâ€‘graph Generation** â€“ builds a weighted graph of dayâ€‘wide clusters for advanced visualization and network analysis.  
- **Configâ€‘driven Pipeline** â€“ all runtime options (embedder path, clustering parameters, GenAI endpoint, etc.) live in JSON files under `configs/`.  
- **REST API** â€“ clean, versioned endpoints expose clusters, articles, similarity links, and admin utilities.  
- **Extensible Architecture** â€“ swap the embedder, clustering algorithm, or GenAI provider by editing configuration only; code is organised into isolated components for easy testing and replacement.
